    Day 3: React Training - Props, Controlled Components & Forms
    
    - Learned and practiced props by passing data between components using variables, objects, arrays, and JSX.
    - Implemented default props, style changes via props, and prop-based rendering.
    - Worked with input fields: defining state, capturing/displaying values, and clearing inputs.
    - Explored controlled components, built forms with validation, and compared with uncontrolled components.
    - Implemented checkboxes, radio buttons, and dropdowns with default values and state management.
    - Practiced rendering lists and tables using the map function.
    - Reused components in loops with dynamic props and applied clean styling for better UI.
